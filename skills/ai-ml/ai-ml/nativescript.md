- Organize code using modular components and services for maintainability.
- Use platform-specific files (`.ios.ts`, `.android.ts`) when code exceeds 20 platform-specific lines.
- When creating custom native code, use a folder structure like `custom-native/index.ios.ts`, `custom-native/index.android.ts`, `custom-native/common.ts`, `custom-native/index.d.ts` to keep platform-specific code organized and easy to import with single import elsewhere, replacing `custom-native` with the name of the custom code.
- Prefix platform-specific variables with `ios` or `android` (e.g., `iosButtonStyle`).
- Name custom components and styles descriptively (`primaryButtonStyle`, `userProfileView`).
- Use `@NativeClass()` when extending native classes when needed
- For iOS, when extending native classes, always use `static ObjCProtocols = [AnyUIKitDelegate];` to declare custom delegates if a delegate is required or used.
- For iOS, always retain custom delegate instances to prevent garbage collection. For example, `let delegate = MyCustomDelegate.new() as MyCustomDelegate`, and ensure it is retained in the class scope.
- Favor `__ANDROID__` and `__APPLE__` for conditional platform code with tree-shaking.
- Track and clean up all timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) to avoid memory leaks.
- Always TailwindCSS as the CSS Framework using `"@nativescript/tailwind": "^2.1.0"` for consistent styling paired with `"tailwindcss": "~3.4.0"`.
- Add ios: and android: style variants for platform-specific styling, addVariant('android', '.ns-android &'), addVariant('ios', '.ns-ios &');
- darkMode: ['class', '.ns-dark']
- Leverage `GridLayout` or `StackLayout` for flexible, responsive layouts. Place more emphasis on proper GridLayout usage for complex layouts but use StackLayout for simpler, linear arrangements.
- Use `visibility: 'hidden'` for elements that should not affect layout when hidden.
- Try to avoid deeply nesting layout containers but instead use `GridLayout` wisely to setup complex layouts.
- Avoid direct manipulation of the visual tree during runtime to minimize rendering overhead.
- Optimize images using compression tools like TinyPNG to reduce memory and app size.
- Clean the project (`ns clean`) after modifying files in `App_Resources` or `package.json`.
- Reuse components and styles to avoid duplication.
- Use template selectors (`itemTemplateSelector`) for conditional layouts in `ListView` and `RadListView`.
- Minimize heavy computations in UI bindings or methods.
- Only if using plain xml bindings, use `Observable` or `ObservableArray` properties to reflect state changes efficiently.
- When using Angular, React, Solid, Svelte or Vue, always leverage their respective state management, lifecycle hooks, rendering optimizations and reactive bindings for optimal performance.

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use @nativescript/secure-storage for sensitive data
- Use @nativescript/biometrics for anything related to biometrics
- Always use nativescript-fonticon for font icons
- Follow NativeScript best practices for performance

description: Enforces the recommended folder structure for NativeScript projects at the root level, including assets, src, and nativescript.config.ts.
globs: *.*
---
- Ensure the following structure is present at the root of your NativeScript project with the exception of some frameworks which may use `app/` instead of `src/`. The other exception is that in web based editors like StackBlitz or Bolt, the `App_Resources` can be omitted:
  - App_Resources/
    - Android/
    - iOS/
  - src/
    - assets/
    - components/
    - fonts/
    - services/
    - utils/
  - nativescript.config.ts
  - tailwind.config.js
