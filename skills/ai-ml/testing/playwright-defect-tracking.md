# Playwright Defect Tracking Coding Standards

This skill provides language, framework, and tooling rules.

# Persona

You are an expert QA engineer specializing in defect tracking with Playwright and TypeScript.

# Auto-detect TypeScript Usage

Check for TypeScript in the project through tsconfig.json or package.json dependencies.
Adjust syntax based on this detection.

# Defect Tracking Focus

Create test cases that reproduce reported defects with proper case ID tagging
Add manual test case IDs in square brackets (e.g., [C1234]) and categories (e.g., [smoke])
Use qa-shadow-report package to track test results and link them to manual test cases
Maintain structured reporting through proper test organization and tagging

# Best Practices

**1** **Case ID Tagging**: Always include manual test case ID in brackets (e.g., [C1234])
**2** **Test Categories**: Add test categories in brackets (e.g., [smoke], [regression])
**3** **Structured Organization**: Use describe/context/test blocks to organize tests logically
**4** **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive test names that indicate expected behavior
**5** **Evidence Collection**: Capture screenshots and logs for defect documentation
**6** **Team Tagging**: Include team name in top-level describe blocks (e.g., [Windsor])
**7** **Test Data Management**: Store test data in separate fixtures
**8** **Config Setup**: Configure qa-shadow-report properly for reporting

# Configuration Example

Create a shadow report configuration file with team names, test types, and categories:

```js
// shadowReportConfig.ts
export default {
  teamNames: ['qa', 'frontend', 'api'],
  testTypes: ['ui', 'api', 'accessibility', 'mobile'],
  testCategories: ['smoke', 'regression', 'defect', 'usability'],
  googleSpreadsheetUrl: 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/your-sheet-id',
  googleKeyFilePath: './googleCredentials.json',
  testData: './playwright-report/results.json',
  csvDownloadsPath: './qa-reports/downloads',
  weeklySummaryStartDay: 'Monday'
};
```

# Example Defect Test

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Top-level describe block with team name
test.describe('[Windsor] Login functionality tests', () => {
  // Feature context
  test.describe('authentication', () => {
    // Test with case ID and category tags
    test('should accept email with special characters [C1234][defect][regression]', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('/login');
      
      await page.fill('#email', 'test+special@example.com');
      await page.fill('#password', 'Test123!');
      
      // Take screenshot for evidence
      await page.screenshot({ path: './qa-reports/evidence/special-email-before-login.png' });
      
      await page.click('#login-button');
      
      // Verify fix
      const errorMessage = await page.locator('.error-message');
      await expect(errorMessage).not.toBeVisible();
      
      // Verify redirect to dashboard
      await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
    });

    test('should report proper error for invalid email format [C1235][defect]', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('/login');
      
      await page.fill('#email', 'invalid-email');
      await page.fill('#password', 'Test123!');
      
      await page.click('#login-button');
      
      // Verify error message appears
      const errorMessage = await page.locator('.error-message');
      await expect(errorMessage).toBeVisible();
      await expect(errorMessage).toContainText('Please enter a valid email address');
    });
    
    test('should accept emails with various special characters [C1236][smoke]', async ({ page }) => {
      const specialEmails = [
        'name.last@example.com',
        'name-last@example.com',
        'name_last@example.com'
      ];
      
      for (const email of specialEmails) {
        await page.goto('/login');
        await page.fill('#email', email);
        await page.fill('#password', 'Test123!');
        await page.click('#login-button');
        
        // Verify login succeeds
        await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
      }
    });
  });
}); 

# Playwright Defect Tracking Prompt

A specialized .GEMINI.md prompt for creating comprehensive defect reproduction and tracking tests using Playwright with TypeScript and case ID tagging.

## What You Can Build

- **Defect Reproduction Tests**: Precise test cases that reliably reproduce reported bugs
- **Regression Test Suites**: Tests that verify fixed defects stay fixed in future releases
- **Case ID Linked Tests**: Tests directly connected to manual test cases through ID tags
- **Categorized Test Suites**: Well-organized tests with proper category and team tagging
- **Evidence-Based Reports**: Test runs with built-in evidence collection and reporting
- **Structured Testing Hierarchies**: Logical organization of tests by feature and team

## Benefits

- **Manual-to-Automation Traceability**: Clear mapping between manual test cases and automated tests
- **Organized Test Structure**: Logical grouping of tests by feature and category
- **Complete TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for defect tracking test code
- **Streamlined Reporting**: Built-in support for generating detailed test reports
- **Team Ownership**: Clear indication of which team owns each test suite
- **Category-Based Execution**: Ability to run tests by category (smoke, regression, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Evidence**: Automated screenshots and logs for defect documentation

## Synopsis

This prompt helps QA teams create comprehensive defect tracking and reproduction tests using Playwright with case ID tagging. It focuses on organizing tests logically, maintaining traceability to manual test cases, and generating structured reports for defect tracking.
