## 📢 Latest Release (v2.0 - Local Sync)
- **Environment Agnosticism**: Replaced absolute local paths with universal relative paths (`~/.gemini/`) across rule sets and workflows for safe, seamless deployment by any user.
- **Tauri MacOS Automation**: Introduced `tauri-ship.sh` inside `tools/` for automated MacOS App bundle building and DMG generation, integrated directly into agent behavior.
- **Workflow Consolidation**: Deprecated redundant workflows (`context-compress.md`, `master.md`, `implement.md`, etc.) and refined the core toolkit with new dedicated workflows like `api-integrations.md` and `git-hooks-qa.md`.
- **Global Rules Refinement**: Enhanced `agent-behavior.md` for safe SQLite data gathering, automatic external link tracking, and rigorous internal QA gate loops.

## 📖 Project Vision & Target Audience

This framework was built with a clear purpose: **empowering Technical Product Managers (PMs) and Founders to build entire digital products autonomously**.

AI coding assistants (like Google Antigravity, Claude Code, or Cursor) often suffer from context bloat and unpredictable code generation. Left unchecked, agents act like hyperactive junior developers—eagerly writing 500 lines of broken code for features they barely understand, ignoring existing constraints or architecture.

This framework solves that by enforcing **Spec-Driven Development**. It forces the IDE to behave like a strict **Tech Lead / Automated Engineering Team**. The system will literally refuse to write large chunks of code without a proper `micro-spec.md` and rigorously enforces project memory. 

### Key Philosophy
1. **Architecture first, code second**: The agent halts abstract requests and forces a structured `/feature-interview` to gather business requirements before touching the codebase.
2. **Project Memory (`GEMINI.md`)**: The AI reads a single source of truth in your project root to understand the stack, boundaries, and technical debt, saving context window resources.
3. **No Bullshit Rule**: The AI is instructed to give ultra-short "yes/no" responses by default, act as your technical co-founder, and acknowledge errors instantly without hallucinating excuses.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

To use this framework, you need to link or copy these rules into your IDE's global AI assistant brain.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/helgklaizar/antigravity-ai-framework.git
cd antigravity-ai-framework
```

### 2. Apply to Google Antigravity (or similar standard helpers)
If you are using **Google Antigravity IDE** or an assistant that reads global configuration from an isolated dotfolder (e.g., `~/.gemini/`):

```bash
# 1. Ensure your global AI directory exists
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/

# 2. Copy the entire structure into your root config
cp -R global_rules/* ~/.gemini/
cp -R templates ~/.gemini/
cp -R workflows ~/.gemini/
cp -R skills ~/.gemini/antigravity/
```

*Note: For **Claude Code** or **Cursor**, add the contents of `global_rules/` into your IDE's custom Prompt Ruleset window.*

---

## 🛠 Usage Guide

### Creating a New Project
Whenever you scaffold a new repository, your **very first action** should be initiating the `GEMINI.md` file in your root folder:

```bash
cp ~/.gemini/templates/gemini-index.md ./GEMINI.md
```
*Fill in your tech stack, run commands, and architecture. The AI will read this file every time it opens the project.*

### Triggering Workflows
Interact with your AI using specific slash-commands mapped to the files in `workflows/`:

- **`/new-project`** — Automates the instantiation of an extensible project scaffolding following strict architecture rules.
- **`/feature-interview`** — The AI will ask you precise product-management questions to narrow down a vague idea into concrete requirements.
- **`/ui-prototyping`** — Forces the AI to bypass raw HTML and generate production-ready React/Tailwind code with proper structured design.
- **`/api-integrations`** — Triggers the framework's strict rules for building robust API endpoints and E2E tests.
- **`/git-hooks-qa`** — Runs automated QA (linting, tests, build) in a loop until the code is fully functional and safe to ship.
- **`/pentest-qa`** — Triggers security audit workflow and vulnerability scanning to harden your application.
- **`/adversarial-review`** — Paste your technical/product plan, and the AI will try to destroy it by finding edge cases, security flaws, and architectural bottlenecks before you waste time building it.
