## 🎯 Что это за проект? (What is this project?)

This repository is the **Global Master Database** for the Antigravity IDE and AI coding agents. It transforms a standard AI coding assistant into a fully autonomous, context-aware development team (Swarm). 

Its primary purpose is to **provide a universal standard** and prevent context fragmentation. Instead of each project having its own isolated and outdated AI instructions, this ecosystem centralizes everything into a single, highly-curated repository that anyone can use for any tech stack.

### Core Features:
1. **Curated Skills (`/skills`)**: Highly specific technical instructions covering all modern tech stacks (Python, Rust, React, Node.js, etc).
2. **Global Workflows (`/global_workflows`)**: Orchestration pipelines triggered via `/slash-commands` (e.g., website cloning, background research, PR reviews).
3. **Specialized Agents (`/agents`)**: Distinct AI personas (Architect, QA, DevOps) that can be swapped dynamically.
4. **Architectural Templates (`/templates`)**: Standardized project configurations:
   - `GEMINI.md`: The universal project constitution featuring **Compound Memory** (Project Learnings).
   - `SWARM_STATE.md`: For agent handovers and parallel **Git Worktree** execution.

## 🏛️ The "Lean Architecture" Paradigm

**We strictly enforce the Flat Global Architecture Rule.**
Unlike older setups where every project had its own messy `.gemini/` hidden folder full of duplicate prompts, this ecosystem runs centrally from `~/.gemini/antigravity/`. 

* **No Duplicates**: A skill is updated here, and it instantly applies to all your projects.
* **No Blind Spots**: The IDE parses the exact same workflows regardless of what directory your terminal is in.
* **Auto-Formatting Hooks**: Seamless integration with `prettier`, `rustfmt`, and `ruff` on the IDE level.

## ⚡ The Antigravity Bar (Status Bar App)

This project includes a lightweight native background application which acts as the bridge between this GitHub repository and your Local System.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Zero-Prompt Onboarding**: Drop the GitHub repo link into the chat, and the AI will analyze your local system (`uname`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`), select the relevant skills, and build your environment automatically.
- **Ecosystem Syncing**: Automatically fetches and updates the latest workflows and skills directly from GitHub.
- **Context Switching**: The Status Bar detects the active IDE window and dynamically swaps your active `PROFILE.md` pre-sets to prevent AI context hallucination.
- **System Permissions Management**: Natively handles requesting required OS permissions before running scripts.
- **Security Guardrails**: Enforces "Safe Mode" blocking rogue `npm` scripts and requiring strict `pnpm`/`cargo` validation.

## 🚀 First-Time Onboarding

There are two ways to set up your perfectly tailored environment:

### Flow A: AI-Driven Onboarding (Recommended)
1. Open **Antigravity IDE**.
2. Drop the repository link into the AI chat: `https://github.com/helgklaizar/AI-Ecosystem`
3. The Agent will autonomously find `AI_ONBOARDING.md`, read the instructions, install the Status Bar, and interactively compile your `settings.json` based on your stack.

### Flow B: Visual Setup
1. Compile and launch the **Antigravity Bar** from the `status-bar/` folder.
2. Follow the sleek setup wizard.
3. Select your tech stack. The Status Bar will pull ONLY the necessary assets from this Global Database into your `~/.gemini/antigravity/` folder to keep your IDE blazing fast.
